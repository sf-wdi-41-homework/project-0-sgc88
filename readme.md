# **Links and website for resource:**
## **W3schools:**
I found W3schools pretty helpful  https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_which.asp . W3schools is very helpful for me in terms of using methods and objects. I learned keydown method, event.which object with examples from W3school- they have an examples that you can test it to see how it actually works.
 They have very simple examples for each method and objects.
##  **JQUERY documentation:**
 Go https://api.jquery.com/  if you are looking for jQuery methods. This website is very useful to find any jquery method. They also have good examples with details etc. They explain each method with details and small exaples. I like to use jQuery to find which method I need and use other websites like W3school to understand how it works and how i can use it for my project.
## **Stackoverflow:**
I used this website for CSS https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730035/how-to-change-css-using-jquery. I found stackoverflow very helpful for manipulating CSS with jQuery.

##  **And of course  YOUTUBE for practicing.**
**Note:** To check out readme.md before committing I used https://stackedit.io/editor . it is very easy to use just on your browser- don't have to download.
