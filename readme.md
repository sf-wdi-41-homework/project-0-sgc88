##Technologies :
I used HTML,JS, jQuery, CSS.
##Existing features:

Planned feature: Animations when there is a winner such as gifies, changing the screen from game board to celebration board. Store the score for players. make the game more challenging each time they win.
##Links and website for resource:
I found W3School pretty helpful ** https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_which.asp ** . W3school is very helpful for me in terms of using methods and objects. I learned keydown method, event.which object with examples from W3school- they have an examples that you can test it to see how it actually works.
 They have very simple examples for each method and objects.
#JQUERY documentation ** https://api.jquery.com/ **, This website is very useful to find any jquery method. They also have good examples with details etc. They explain each method with details and small exaples. I like to use jQuery to find which method I need and use other websites like W3school to understand how it works and how i can use it for my project.
#Stackoverflow for CSS **https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730035/how-to-change-css-using-jquery**. I found stackoverflow very helpful for manipulating CSS with jQuery.
And of course ## YOUTUBE for practicing.
